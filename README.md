# LLM Selector

The  **LLM  Selector**  is a tool to help you choose the most suitable Large Language Model (LLM) for your needs based on your system's hardware capabilities. It evaluates your machine's specifications and recommends LLMs that are compatible and likely to perform well.

## Key Features

-   **Compatibility Check**: The tool assesses your system's memory, CPU cores, and GPU to recommend LLMs that will run smoothly.
-   **Performance Scores**: It provides performance scores for each LLM, giving you an idea of how well they are expected to perform on your system.
-   **Variety of Options**: Offers a range of LLMs with different strengths and weaknesses, allowing you to select the one that best fits your requirements.
-   **User-Friendly Interface**: The interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy to navigate and choose the right LLM.

## Important Notes

-   The tool is regularly updated with new LLMs and performance data based on Gaia's [node-configs repo](https://github.com/GaiaNet-AI/node-configs). 
-   It serves as a starting point, and further research may be necessary to make the best decision for your specific use case.

## Example Recommendations

Based on the provided hardware specifications (8 GB Memory, 8 CPU Cores, Apple M2 GPU), the tool suggests the following LLMs:

-   **Llama 3 8B Lexi Uncensored GGUF**
-   **Llama 3 8b_Rust_8k_PT_RPL**
-   **codegemma 7b it**
-   **deepseek r1 distill llama 8b**
    
Each model comes with a performance score and an initialization command to help you get started.

This tool is ideal for users looking to optimize their LLM selection process based on their hardware capabilities.
